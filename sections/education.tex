		{2020 - 2024}
		{End-to-end and cascaded Spoken Language Undertanding (SLU) systems within the AISSPER project, funded by ANR (Agence Nationale de la Recherche) grant \textit{ANR-19-CE23-0004}. Under the supervision of Sylvain Meignier, Nathalie Camelin and Antoine Laurent.\newline% 
		Different kind of architectures were proposed: a state-of-the-art LSTM encoder-decoder model built to perform both the ASR and semantic information extraction from the speech. Furthermore, a novel hybrid end-to-end and cascaded approach was evaluated. Other architectures were constructed and evaluated, including architectures based on SSL pretrained models such as wav2vec2, BERT, LLMs (Llama, GPT), as well as multimodal and multilingual models.
